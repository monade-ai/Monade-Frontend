# Monade Landing Page Codebase Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the Monade Landing Page codebase.

## Project Overview

The project is a Next.js application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It also uses `three.js` for 3D animations.

## File Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js structure:

- `src/app/`: Contains the main application pages.
  - `page.tsx`: The main entry point of the application.
  - `layout.tsx`: The main layout of the application.
  - `globals.css`: Global CSS styles.
- `src/components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `StackAnimation.tsx`: A 3D animation of a stack of blocks.
  - `PhoneUI.tsx`: A UI component that simulates a phone call.
- `public/`: Contains static assets like images and audio.
- `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Key Components

- **`page.tsx`**: The main page component that renders the entire landing page. It imports and uses the `StackAnimation` and `PhoneUI` components.
- **`StackAnimation.tsx`**: A component that renders a 3D animation of a stack of blocks using CSS 3D transforms.
- **`PhoneUI.tsx`**: A component that renders a UI that simulates a phone call, including connection status, call duration, and call controls.

## Dependencies

- **`next`**: The core Next.js framework.
- **`react`**: The React library for building user interfaces.
- **`three`**: A 3D graphics library used for the stack animation.
- **`tailwindcss`**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Scripts

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`build`**: Builds the application for production.
- **`start`**: Starts the production server.
- **`lint`**: Lints the codebase.

## Conclusion

The codebase is well-structured and uses modern web development technologies. The landing page is visually appealing with 3D animations and a simulated phone call UI.

# MONADE.AI WEBSITE COPY FRAMEWORK
## Practical System for B2B SaaS Voice AI Copywriting

---

## COPY AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

You are writing for a B2B voice AI company with **deep expertise** in conversation science, sales psychology, and Indian market dynamics.

**Your mission:** Transform technical depth into persuasive, credible copy that positions Monade.ai as the company that actually understands why voice AI converts.

**Core positioning:** "We're not just another voice AI platform. We're the company that figured out the invisible science behind conversations that convert."

---

## SECTION 1: MASTER COPY HIERARCHY

### Level 1: Primary Value Proposition (Hero Section)
**Template:**
[Bold claim about the problem] + [Why others fail] + [What makes you different]

**Example:**
"Most voice AI sounds like spam and gets hung up on.
The reason? They ignore conversation science.
We spent 6 months researching what makes humans actually say yes on phone calls—then built the platform that implements it."

**Your version:**
- Lead with specific problem (8-second spam gate, not generic "inefficiency")
- Show you understand WHY competitors fail (they don't know conversation mechanics)
- Position differentiation as depth of understanding (research-backed vs feature-based)

---

### Level 2: Core Capabilities (What Section)
**Structure:** Problem → Hidden Complexity → Your Solution → Specific Mechanism

**Template per capability:**
```
**[Capability Name]**
The problem: [Surface issue]
Why it's hard: [Hidden complexity competitors don't see]
How we solve it: [Specific mechanism]
What this means: [Business outcome]
```

**Example 1: Conversation Architecture**
```
**8-Stage Conversation Architecture (Not Random Chat)**

The problem: Most voice AI has no structure—just responds to whatever the customer says.

Why it's hard: Phone conversations have specific turn-taking rules, grounding requirements, and adjacency pairs that create conditional relevance. Violate these = sounds robotic.

How we solve it: Every script follows 8 stages with duration targets, branching logic, and built-in repair sequences:
1. Opening (permission gate)
2. Rapport (trust building)
3. Discovery (need identification)
4. Presentation (value matching)
5. Objection handling (pre-empted + reactive)
6. Closing (commitment chain)
7. Follow-up (next steps)
8. Referrals (expansion)

What this means: Conversations feel natural because they follow human dialogue structure, not AI randomness.
```

**Example 2: 43:57 Talk Ratio**
```
**Built-In Talk Ratio Enforcement (Why Most AI Over-Talks)**

The problem: AI tends to monologue. Customers tune out.

Why it's hard: Gong.io analyzed millions of sales calls and found that when sellers talk >43% of conversation time, prospects don't buy. But most AI scripts are 70-80% AI talking.

How we solve it: Every conversation stage has designed questions, micro-grounding checks, and natural pauses that force prospect participation. Result: AI talks ≤43%, prospect talks ≥57%.

What this means: Higher engagement, better qualification, more conversions (Gong.io data: 43:57 ratio = golden ratio for sales).
```

**Your task:** Write 6-8 core capability blocks following this structure.

---

### Level 3: Differentiation Points (Why Us vs Them)
**Template:**
[Competitor approach] → [Why it fails] → [Our approach] → [Evidence]

**Example:**
```
**Generic Platforms: "No-Code Voice AI Setup"**
→ But they give you a blank canvas and expect you to know conversation design
→ We give you pre-engineered conversation architecture based on 18 research-backed principles
→ Evidence: Our scripts follow adjacency pair rules (Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson 1974), working memory limits (Baddeley & Hitch), and prospect theory loss framing (Kahneman & Tversky)
```

**Your task:** Create comparison table:
| What They Say | Why It's Not Enough | What We Do | Research Basis |
|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|

---

## SECTION 2: BENTO CARD COPY SYSTEM

Each bento card = **One insight that makes competitors look shallow**

### Card Formula:
1. **Headline:** Specific problem or counterintuitive insight (8-12 words)
2. **Body:** 3-part structure (50-80 words)
   - The invisible problem
   - Why it matters (data/research)
   - How you solve it (specific mechanism)
3. **Visual:** Diagram, stat, or example
4. **CTA:** Learn more about [specific thing]

---

### Bento Card Examples:

#### CARD 1: "The 8-Second Trust Gate"
**Headline:** "You have 8 seconds before they assume it's spam"

**Body:**
Indian customers get 30+ junk calls weekly. Truecaller culture means unknown numbers = instant suspicion.

Most voice AI scripts fail this gate because they:
- Don't identify caller fast enough
- Launch into pitch before permission
- Use wrong register (too casual too fast)

We pass it every time: Identity + Context + Permission in first 8 seconds. Based on Schegloff's research on telephone opening sequences (1968).

**CTA:** See opening sequence examples

---

#### CARD 2: "The 43:57 Rule" 
**Headline:** "When AI talks too much, prospects don't buy"

**Body:**
Gong.io analyzed millions of sales calls. The pattern is clear: when sellers talk >43% of conversation time, deals are lost.

Most AI scripts violate this (they monologue 70-80% of the call).

Our scripts enforce 43:57 through designed questions, micro-grounding checks, and natural turn-yielding cues. Every stage has built-in prompts that force prospect participation.

**Visual:** Talk ratio bar chart (Failed AI: 80/20 | Converting AI: 43/57)

**CTA:** See conversation flow design

---

#### CARD 3: "Code-Switching Science"
**Headline:** "Technical terms in English. Trust phrases in Hindi. Here's why."

**Body:**
ACL research on Hindi-English discourse shows code-switching isn't random—it's strategic.

English signals: Authority, expertise, technical precision (EMI, ROI, site visit)
Hindi signals: Warmth, relatability, trust (अच्छा, samajh mein aaya, theek hai)

Wrong mix = sounds fake. Right mix = feels natural.

Our scripts follow linguistic protocols based on psycholinguistic research on bilingual Indian conversations.

**CTA:** Download language guidelines

---

#### CARD 4: "Loss Frame First"
**Headline:** "People fear loss 2x more than they value gain"

**Body:**
Kahneman & Tversky's Prospect Theory: humans overweight losses relative to equivalent gains by approximately 2:1.

Most pitches lead with gains: "You'll close more deals!"
Our scripts lead with losses: "Right now, 30% of your inbound calls go unanswered. At your deal size, that's ₹4-5 lakhs walking away monthly."

Then we show the gain. But loss frame first hooks attention.

**Visual:** Prospect Theory curve diagram

**CTA:** See persuasion mechanics

---

#### CARD 5: "AI Latency Design"
**Headline:** "Voice AI has 400-1200ms response delay. We design for it."

**Body:**
Generic scripts sound robotic because they ignore latency constraints:
- Awkward silences during processing
- No filler phrase variety
- Can't handle interruptions
- No reconnection protocols

Our scripts include:
✓ 5+ varied filler phrases per stage
✓ Interruption handling (stop→acknowledge→redirect)
✓ Tiered fallback for misunderstanding
✓ Reconnection protocols for silence

Result: Sounds human despite technical constraints.

**CTA:** See latency management system

---

#### CARD 6: "Scripts That Learn"
**Headline:** "Week 1 script ≠ Week 12 script. It gets better."

**Body:**
Every call generates:
- Transcript with conversation stage markers
- Objection pattern analysis
- Drop-off point identification
- Cultural fit scoring (honorifics, code-switching, register)

We refine scripts every week based on what actually converts in your vertical.

Not machine learning. Human-in-loop optimization based on real conversation data.

**CTA:** See evaluation rubric

---

### Your Task: Create 6-8 Bento Cards

**Mandatory cards:**
1. 8-second trust gate (Schegloff)
2. 43:57 talk ratio (Gong.io)
3. Adjacency pair design (conversation analysis)
4. Cultural compliance (Indian market)
5. Persuasion mechanics (behavioral science)
6. AI latency management (VUI design)

**Optional cards:**
7. Family decision dynamics
8. Code-switching protocols
9. Micro-commitment chains
10. Objection pre-emption (inoculation theory)
11. Autonomy preservation (reactance theory)
12. CRM integration + learning loop

---

## SECTION 3: LANDING PAGE SECTIONS

### Section 1: Hero (Above Fold)
**Components:**
- **Headline:** Problem + insight (12-20 words)
- **Subhead:** What makes you different (20-30 words)
- **Primary CTA:** See sample script for [vertical]
- **Secondary CTA:** Download research framework
- **Trust signals:** Research citations, vertical logos, conversion data

**Example Hero:**
```
Headline:
"Most voice AI sounds like spam. Yours shouldn't."

Subhead:
"We spent 6 months researching why humans say yes on phone calls—then built the platform that actually implements conversation science. Built for Indian market dynamics."

CTA 1: "See a sample script for your vertical"
CTA 2: "Download the 18 principles"

Trust bar: "Built on research from: Stanford, MIT, Gong.io, TRAI compliance"
```

---

### Section 2: Problem Amplification
**Purpose:** Show you deeply understand the problem

**Structure:**
1. Surface problem ("We miss inbound calls")
2. Hidden complexity (8-second gate, talk ratio, cultural protocols)
3. Why generic solutions fail (they don't know conversation science)
4. What's really required (18 principles you discovered)

**Example Copy:**
```
**Why do most voice AI calls fail?**

It's not the technology. LiveKit works. Gemini 2.5 Live works. The platforms all function.

The failure happens in the first 8 seconds:
- Indian customers assume unknown numbers = spam (Truecaller culture)
- Generic scripts don't establish trust fast enough
- Wrong register destroys credibility ('tum' with strangers)
- No permission gate before pitch
- Sounds like reading a script

Then it fails in conversation structure:
- AI monologues (violates 43:57 talk ratio)
- Asks vague questions (gets vague answers)
- Ignores adjacency pair rules (feels unnatural)
- Can't handle interruptions properly
- No repair sequences for misunderstanding

Finally it fails in cultural fit:
- Doesn't code-switch strategically
- Bulldozes family consultation
- Treats WhatsApp as brush-off
- Wrong price framing (total cost first, not EMI)

Generic platforms give you AI. We give you conversation science.
```

---

### Section 3: Solution (Methodology Showcase)
**Purpose:** Show your unique approach

**Format:** The 18 Principles

**Copy approach:**
- Group into 5 categories (Conversation Mechanics, Persuasion Psychology, Cultural Context, AI-Specific, Compliance)
- Each principle: Name + 1-line explanation + Research citation
- Link to detailed PDF

**Example:**
```
**The 18 Non-Negotiable Principles**

Every voice AI script that converts follows these rules. We discovered them through 6 months of research across conversation science, sales psychology, and Indian market dynamics.

**Conversation Mechanics**
1. Permission Before Pitch → 8-second identity + context + ask (Schegloff 1968)
2. One Idea Per Breath → Working memory limits demand chunking (Baddeley & Hitch 1974)
3. Designed Adjacency Pairs → Specific questions yield useful answers (Sacks et al. 1974)
4. 43:57 Talk Ratio → Prospect must talk more than AI (Gong.io millions of calls)
5. Built-In Repair Sequences → Handle misunderstanding gracefully (Schegloff et al. 1977)

**Persuasion Psychology**
6. Loss Frame Before Gain → 2x loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky 1979)
7. Anchor Early → Set mental benchmark (Tversky & Kahneman 1974)
8. Micro-Commitments → Small yeses before big ask (Cialdini 2021)
9. Autonomy Preservation → Reduce reactance (Brehm 1966)
10. Inoculate Before Pitch → Pre-empt objection (McGuire 1961)

### Section 5: Proof (Not Testimonials—Show the Work)
**Purpose:** Build trust through transparency

**Components:**
1. **Real script excerpts** with mechanism annotations
2. **Before/after transcripts** (generic vs optimized)
3. **Evaluation rubric** (8 dimensions with scoring)
4. **Vertical case studies** (challenge → solution → result → key insight)
5. **Research citations** (link to papers)

**Example Case Study Format:**
```
**Real Estate | Mumbai Brokers**

Challenge:
- 8-second spam perception (high junk call volume)
- Family decision dynamics (not solo decisions)
- Site visit booking friction (timing coordination)

Script Approach:
- Riya persona (female, soft-spoken, respectful)
- Permission-based opening (Name ji, context, ask)
- Family walkthrough offer (embrace, don't fight)
- Flexible scheduling (weekend family sessions)

Principles Applied:
- #1: Permission Before Pitch (8-second gate)
- #12: Family Decisions Are Real (not objection)
- #7: Anchor Early (typical broker miss rate 10-30%)

Result:
- Booking rate: 2.1% → 6.3% (3x improvement)
- Average call time: 2.8 min (vs 4.5 min generic)
- Drop-off point: Moved from 18s to 47s

Key Insight:
"Ji" honorific usage in first 30s correlated with +40% trust score. Register matters more than pitch quality in Indian market.

[CTA: View technical documentation]
```

---

### Section 8: Pricing (Transparency + Differentiation)
**Purpose:** Show value vs platform fee model

**Copy Structure:**
```
**Pay for Outcomes, Not Platform Fees**

❌ **Typical Voice AI Pricing:**
₹10,000-50,000/month platform fee
+ ₹50-100 per call
+ Setup fees
+ Integration fees
= You pay even when nothing converts

✅ **Our Model:**
₹0 platform fee
+ ₹3-5 per minute customers actually speak
= Pay only for conversation time

**What's Included:**
✓ Knowledge base → script generation
✓ 8-stage conversation architecture
✓ Cultural compliance layer (TRAI, DPDP Act)
✓ Multi-CRM integration
✓ Real-time transcript analysis
✓ Weekly script refinement
✓ Objection pattern reporting

**Real Example:**
Average call: 3 minutes
Cost per call: ₹9-15
Conversion rate: 6% (vs 2% industry baseline)
Customer LTV: ₹50,000
Cost per acquisition: ₹150-250

ROI: 200x+

**Why This Works:**
If your voice AI doesn't convert → you pay almost nothing
If it does convert → you're happy to pay for results

[CTA: Calculate your ROI]
```

## SECTION 4: FAQ COPY (Anticipate Objections)

### Question Formula:
- Start with actual customer concern (don't sterilize it)
- Acknowledge the underlying fear
- Provide specific mechanism (not generic reassurance)
- Give proof/example when possible

---

### FAQ Examples:

**Q: "Will it sound robotic? I hate those IVR bots."**

A: Most people do. And yes, generic voice AI sounds robotic.

The reason: They ignore conversation mechanics. No latency management, no interruption handling, no repair sequences, no natural turn-yielding cues.

Our scripts are designed for AI constraints:
- 5+ varied filler phrases (not same "hmm" every time)
- Interruption protocol (stop immediately, acknowledge, then redirect)
- Tiered fallback for misunderstanding (rephrase → multiple choice → human callback)
- Natural pauses that signal turn-taking

Result: Sounds human because we engineer around latency, not pretend it doesn't exist.

Want proof? Listen to sample calls from 3 different verticals. If it sounds like IVR hell, we're not doing our job.

---

**Q: "What if customer speaks only Hindi/Tamil/other regional language?"**

A: Our scripts adapt within 1-2 turns.

Default opening: Hinglish (most broadly understood in urban India)
Detection: If customer responds in pure Hindi/Tamil/etc, AI switches
Code-switching protocol: Match their language mix

Regional personas:
- Marathi (Maharashtra agriculture, real estate)
- Tamil (Tamil Nadu education, finance)
- Telugu (Andhra/Telangana tech, real estate)

We don't force English on non-English speakers. Linguistic respect = trust.

---

**Q: "How do you handle angry or frustrated customers?"**

A: Detection + de-escalation, not bulldozing.

**Early detection signals:**
- Tone shift
- Interrupt frequency
- Negative word patterns ("waste of time", "don't call again")

**De-escalation protocol:**
1. Acknowledge emotion ("I understand this is frustrating")
2. Restore autonomy ("Would you prefer I call another time?")
3. Offer control ("Should I remove your number?")
4. If they stay: Slow down, simplify, ask permission

**Never:**
- Argue back
- Defend the company
- Persist after clear rejection

Angry ≠ unqualified. We preserve the lead, not burn the bridge.

---

**Q: "Can it handle family objections? 'I need to discuss with my wife/parents/etc'?"**

A: Not just "handle"—we embrace it. Because in Indian market, family consultation is culturally normative, not a stall tactic.

Generic Western scripts treat this as objection to overcome. Ours treat it as legitimate next step:

**Script response:**
"Absolutely, this is a family decision. Would it help if I:
- Send a comparison document you can share?
- Schedule a weekend family walkthrough where everyone can join?
- Share testimonials from families in similar situations?"

**Why this works:**
- Respects collectivist decision-making
- Provides tools for internal selling
- Maintains momentum without pressure

Conversion rate after family consultation: 40-50% (when supported properly).

---

**Q: "What if it doesn't know the answer to something?"**

A: Three-tier fallback system:

**Tier 1 - Clarification:**
"Let me make sure I understood—are you asking about [X] or [Y]?"
(Maybe they weren't clear, or AI misheard)

**Tier 2 - Multiple Choice:**
"I want to give you the right answer. Is this about:
A) [option 1]
B) [option 2]
C) Something else?"
(Narrow down what they mean)

**Tier 3 - Human Callback:**
"That's a great question I want to answer properly. Can I have someone from the team call you in the next 2 hours with details?"
(Preserve lead, don't lose it by guessing)

**Plus:** Every "unknown question" flags for knowledge base update. Next week's script can answer it.

---

**Q: "How long does setup actually take?"**

A: 2-3 days for first vertical. Here's the breakdown:

**Day 1:** You upload knowledge base (product details, pricing, objections, demographics)
**Day 1-2:** We generate script using 18-principle framework
**Day 2:** You review → adjust brand voice → approve cultural fit
**Day 2-3:** Technical integration (CRM, phone system)
**Day 3:** Test calls → refinement → goes live

Each additional vertical: 1 day (we adapt the framework, you just adjust specifics).

Timeline delays usually come from:
- Incomplete knowledge base (unclear pricing, no objection list)
- Internal approval cycles (too many stakeholders)
- CRM integration complexity (legacy systems)

If you have clear product info + simple CRM → 48-hour turnaround is possible.

---

## SECTION 5: CTA STRATEGY

### CTA Hierarchy:

**Primary (High Intent):**
"See a sample script for your vertical"
→ Lead capture + personalized 2-page script excerpt

**Secondary (Research Mode):**
"Download the 18 principles framework"

## FINAL INSTRUCTION FOR COPY AGENT

Your goal: Make every competitor look shallow by showing depth.

When Bolna says "Easy setup" → You show the 18 principles they miss
When Ringg says "AI-powered" → You show the conversation science they ignore
When Sarvam says "Indian languages" → You show code-switching protocols they don't know

Lead with insight. Back with research. Prove with specifics.

That's how you win B2B buyers who are tired of generic AI hype.

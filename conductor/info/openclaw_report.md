## Monade × OpenClaw: “Build a business” website brief (for your copywriter)

### 0) One-line thesis

**OpenClaw is the brain. Monade is the money-making machine around it.**
OpenClaw gives you an always-on agent that can operate through the chat apps you already use (WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Teams, etc.). ([GitHub][1])
Monade turns that agent into an actual **business**: phone numbers, inbound/outbound calling, campaigns, scheduling, transcripts, QA, and analytics.

---

# 1) What OpenClaw is (explain it like a product, not a framework)

**OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices** that “answers you” across messaging channels, and uses a **Gateway** as the control plane. ([GitHub][1])
It’s positioned as “the AI that actually does things” (email, calendar, real-world actions) through chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. ([OpenClaw][2])

**Why this matters for your site:** OpenClaw is not the product customers buy. It’s the *operating system for agents*. The product people buy is what the agent *does for their business*.

### OpenClaw’s ecosystem primitives you should reference (lightly)

* **Skills + ClawHub:** installable capabilities (skills) distributed via ClawHub, with CLI install/update/publish flows. ([OpenClaw][3])
* **Safety defaults:** OpenClaw has DM pairing and sandbox options for non-main sessions (important for trust messaging). ([GitHub][1])
* **Security narrative is real:** the ecosystem faced malicious skill issues; OpenClaw partnered with VirusTotal to scan skills and block/label suspicious ones (defense-in-depth). ([OpenClaw][4])

---

# 2) The positioning you want: “people toy with it → they make money”

You’re describing a pattern like Shopify / Zapier / Twilio: **a consumer-simple surface that becomes a business engine when builders play with it.**

### Position Monade as:

**“The Business Builder for Voice Agents.”**
Not “voice AI platform” (sounds like a tool). Not “call center” (sounds like outsourcing).
**A builder platform** that turns OpenClaw agents into voice-first businesses.

### The central promise (copywriter should anchor on this)

**Build a real business workflow in a weekend. Launch in a day. Iterate daily. Scale without hiring.**

---

# 3) The page should sell a *new unit of value*: “Business Kits”

Don’t sell features. Sell **repeatable profit machines**.

### Definition (use on the page)

**Business Kit =** a pre-built, revenue-positive workflow that includes:

* A call flow (voice script + branching logic)
* Triggers (events that start the sequence)
* Follow-up ladder (callbacks + WhatsApp/SMS nudges)
* Integrations (CRM, calendar, payment links, ticketing)
* Metrics dashboard (conversion, no-show, recovery, revenue)

**This is the key shift:** instead of “here’s our tech,” it’s “pick a kit and deploy a business outcome.”

---

# 4) Website narrative structure (the “Build a business” page)

Give your copywriter this exact structure.

## Section A — Hero: “Pick a business. Launch it.”

**Headline options (choose one style):**

1. **Build a voice-first business in a weekend.**
2. **Turn an OpenClaw agent into a revenue machine.**
3. **Stop hiring for follow-ups. Start shipping outcomes.**

**Subhead (must be concrete):**
Monade gives your agents phone numbers, inbound/outbound calling, campaigns, scheduling, transcripts, and analytics—so you can launch appointment setters, collections agents, support lines, and logistics dispatchers.

**Primary CTA:** “Browse Business Kits”
**Secondary CTA:** “Connect OpenClaw”

## Section B — “What you can build” (tiles, not paragraphs)

Group by business outcome:

* **Acquire:** Speed-to-lead caller, site-visit scheduler
* **Convert:** EMI closer, upsell engine
* **Retain:** churn interceptor, renewal reminder
* **Collect:** invoice collections, fee reminders
* **Operate:** dispatcher, ETA truth machine, ticket triage

Each tile should read like a product:

* **No-Show Killer** → confirms, collects deposit, reschedules automatically
* **KYC Finisher** → doc chase ladder until disbursal
* **WISMO Destroyer** → “where is my order” calls + returns automation
* **Collections CFO** → factual reminders + scheduled promises-to-pay

## Section C — “How it works” (4 steps)

1. **Choose a Kit** (Outcome first)
2. **Connect your data** (CRM / calendar / Shopify / sheets)
3. **Launch** (inbound line or outbound campaign)
4. **Tune** (scripts improve from transcripts + analytics)

## Section D — “Why OpenClaw + Monade is different”

This is where you mention competitors *without naming them*.

**Voice is not the product. Voice is the interface.**
Competitors can “add a phone call to your agent.” (That’s real—ClawdTalk is explicitly “Your bot handles text. We handle voice.” ([ClawdTalk][5]))
But businesses don’t win on “having voice.” They win on:

* campaign execution
* follow-up ladders
* scheduling + confirmations
* QA + transcripts → iteration loops

So the line is:
**“Most tools give your bot a voice. Monade gives your voice a business model.”**

## Section E — Trust & Safety (must exist because the ecosystem has risk headlines)

Use this framing:

* OpenClaw skills are powerful, and that comes with risk; OpenClaw now scans skills via VirusTotal and blocks/labels malicious ones, but it’s not a silver bullet—security is defense-in-depth. ([OpenClaw][4])
* Monade adds business-grade guardrails: permissions, audit logs, human handoff, retention controls, and role-based access (your product-specific claims).

This section is not fear. It’s maturity.

## Section F — Proof: case studies as “field reports”

Keep your cinematic style (it’s working). But each case study should include a standardized “profit box”:

* **Before → After**
* **Protocol** (the sequence)
* **Metric moved**
* **Stack** (OpenClaw + Monade + integrations)

OpenClaw’s own showcase is full of people using it through WhatsApp and building automations; you’re simply extending that energy into *monetizable* workflows. ([OpenClaw][6])

---

# 5) The “builder monetization” section (your most important differentiator)

This is the part that makes it feel like “toy → money.”

## The concept: “Agents as micro-businesses”

Give copywriter language like:

* **Sell it as a service** (charge per appointment booked / per collection recovered / per resolved ticket)
* **Sell it as software** (monthly per seat or per number)
* **Sell it as performance** (rev-share or outcome-based)

### Provide 3 monetization templates (copy-ready)

1. **Outcome pricing:** ₹X per booked visit / per qualified lead
2. **Retainer:** ₹Y/month for automation + monitoring
3. **Usage:** ₹Z per minute + analytics tier

(You don’t need to publish pricing now—just publish *how customers can price what they build*.)

---

# 6) “Business Kit Index” (give your copywriter this list of 20)

These names are the conversion layer. They make kits feel like products.

**Revenue**

1. Speed-to-Lead Engine (calls new inbound leads instantly)
2. Site-Visit Scheduler (real estate)
3. EMI Closer (retail)
4. Upsell Host (restaurants / reservations)
5. Referral Harvester (post-success call)

**Retention**
6) Churn Interceptor (SaaS)
7) Renewal Reminder (insurance)
8) Service Retention Engine (auto dealerships)
9) Parent Whisperer (edtech)
10) VIP Concierge (D2C)

**Cashflow**
11) Collections CFO (B2B invoices)
12) Fee Reminder Parents Don’t Hate (schools)
13) Payment Link Nudge Ladder (subscriptions)
14) Promise-to-Pay Tracker (BFSI)
15) Lapse Prevention Engine (policies)

**Ops**
16) 3 AM Dispatcher (fleets/logistics)
17) ETA Truth Machine (driver calls + updates)
18) Ticket Triage Line (support)
19) KYC Finisher (docs chase)
20) Clinic Front Desk (after-hours booking)

---

# 7) Copy style rules (so the page stays sharp)

Tell your copywriter to enforce:

* **Outcome-first headings.** (“Book 3x more visits,” not “AI-powered calling.”)
* **Protocols, not vibes.** Name the sequence: Confirm → Nudge → Reschedule → Deposit.
* **Specific numbers.** Even when illustrative, show the unit economics (minutes saved, drop-offs reduced).
* **“Pick a kit” mental model.** Make the reader feel like they’re choosing a business, not software.

---

# 8) The single most important sentence for the page

If you only keep one line from this brief, keep this:

**Monade is where OpenClaw agents go to become businesses.**

(That’s the whole page.)

## Sources you can cite in your site research doc (for the copywriter)

* OpenClaw runs on your devices, supports many chat channels; Gateway is the control plane; DM pairing + sandbox options exist. ([GitHub][1])
* ClawHub is the skill registry: search/install/update/publish; report unsafe skills. ([OpenClaw][3])
* OpenClaw markets itself as “AI that actually does things” from WhatsApp/Telegram; community showcases heavy WhatsApp usage + automations. ([OpenClaw][2])
* ClawdTalk positions as “bot handles text, we handle voice,” with voice over Telnyx via WebSocket and mid-call tool execution. ([ClawdTalk][5])
* VirusTotal partnership for scanning ClawHub skills (benign auto-approve; suspicious warnings; malicious blocked; daily re-scans). ([OpenClaw][4])
* Security incident coverage exists (malicious skills), making a trust section mandatory. ([The Hacker News][7])

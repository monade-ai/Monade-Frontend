# Implementation Plan: Track - design_page_20260213

## Phase 1: Architectural Scaffolding
- [ ] Task: Define spatial constants and Fibonacci lineage in a dedicated theme/tokens file (tailoring Tailwind).
- [ ] Task: Scaffold the `/design` page route and implement the "Theology of the Void" Hero Section.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Architectural Scaffolding' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: The Living Bento (Structural)
- [ ] Task: Implement the Dynamic Masonry Grid container using the 8pt modular scale.
- [ ] Task: Create the `CodexCard` component (An evolution of LiquidGlassCard with optimized blur and "Material Persistence").
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'The Living Bento (Structural)' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: The Interactive Laboratory (Functional)
- [ ] Task: Implement the Typography Story (Interactive demo of Golden Leading and Scale as Volume).
- [ ] Task: Implement the Geometry Story (Toggleable overlays for Fibonacci spirals and the 8pt grid).
- [ ] Task: Implement the Citrus Spectrum (Laboratory view of the Lemon #F5D916 and Orange #FF5C00 dialogue).
- [ ] Task: Implement the Haptic Soul (Physics-based cards demonstrating Damped Harmonic Motion and Friction).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'The Interactive Laboratory (Functional)' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Synthesis and Refinement
- [ ] Task: Integrate the Glassmorphic Navigation with Viewport Fluidity functions.
- [ ] Task: Perform a global audit of the "100ms Rule" for all transitions and interactions.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Synthesis and Refinement' (Protocol in workflow.md)
